# Client Application Requirements

This document outlines the requirements and implementation steps for the runtime client application that loads and uses saved camera and projector configurations.

## Overview

The client application is the final runtime component that uses configurations created by the setup wizards to operate a live camera-projector system. It provides a simple interface to start/stop the system and monitor its status.

## Architecture

### Application Flow
1. **Authentication** - User signs in to access their configurations
2. **Configuration Loading** - Load saved camera and projector configurations
3. **Hardware Initialization** - Set up camera and projector with saved settings
4. **Runtime Operation** - Live camera-projector operation with calibration
5. **Monitoring** - Real-time status and performance monitoring

### Data Sources
- **Camera Configurations** - From camera setup wizard (`camera.setupType !== 'projector'`)
- **Projector Configurations** - From projector setup wizard (`camera.setupType === 'projector'`)
- **Calibration Data** - Camera intrinsics, distortion coefficients, homography matrices

## Current Implementation Status
